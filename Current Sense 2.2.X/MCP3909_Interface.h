 these are the globals required by external c files
 there should be as few of these as possible to help keep things clean
 these are all 'extern' and require that the variable is declared in the c file

 only include functions required by external c files
 ideally these are in the same order as in the code listing
 any functions used internally and externally must have the prototype in both the c and h files and should be marked
