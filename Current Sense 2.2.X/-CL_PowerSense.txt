Power Sense 3.0 Branch
open issues
    voltage and current scalars need values
    code has not been tested

5/30/2017
    changed powerWatts to unsigned long - was unsigned integer
        this is to support outputting the timer value for calibration
        not necessary for normal operation, but does not hurt either
        unsigned long already supported in the command board

5/31/2017
    added mW to calculation since each pulse is typically less than 1mW
    added calculations for energy used and watts

6/1/2017
    refined code for calculating power

6/2/2017
    added code to account or when no power is bring used (no pulses)

4/30/2018
    rework of initial Power Sense 3.0 code to incorporate SPI port 1 of the PIC
    added init code for SPI master function for the PIC, and SPI Waveform 
        operation on the MCP
    add power calculation code using data retrieved from MCP through SPI
        communication
